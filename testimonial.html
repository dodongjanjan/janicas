    </li>This ICT training is very useful and very helpful, especially in dealing with digital citizenship subject to learners. It is very important to have a knowledge about ICT, because nowadays, we cannot deny the fact that our learners are dependent on technology in making their projects, school works etc.ICT also important for the teachers to make their work  easier and faster, like making tables and computing grades for  learners and all the beneficial outputs and work of teachers.<li></li>I am so glad and thankful that the Alternative Learning System (ALS) management provide this training to the Community ALS Implementers (CAI) because even me as teacher, I admit that I have difficulties in manipulating and operating computers, but for the help of this 10 days of training I have learned a lot, and that is why I am proud of myself and gain confident to teach our learners on digital citizenship for this coming school year.
